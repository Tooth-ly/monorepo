1 - update mutations and queries in the graphql folder
    graphql/
        queries/
        mutations/
    consider using a graphql client at localhost:4000/graphql for testing and autocompletion

2 - yarn gen to spit out generated/graphql 

3 - check if the database is synced. Sometimes it fails to alter because you already have data in.
    It might throw an error like this "fields can't be null"
    One way to fix it is to run an SQL statement to clear the data.

4 - check if I changed the structure of the data. When react throws undefined, check if I changed
    structure.
